<p>I'm Breandan Doran, a guy with long hair and many interests. One of these interests being coding of course, I really like cooking and making videos of me being an absolute crazy person. 
    However I wouldn't call my "different personalities" on video acting, I'd just call it being funny to whoever agrees. Another interest I have is baseball. Although I said
I quit awhile back, I'm getting more and more interested by it, by the day. I'm really looking forward to meeting you all!</p>
